Boots HHVM together with Nginx on Heroku and for local development.

Usage:
  heroku-hhvm-nginx [options] [<DOCUMENT_ROOT>]

Options:
  -C <nginx.inc.conf>     The path to the configuration file to include inside
                          the Nginx server config (see option -c below). Will
                          be included inside the 'server { ... }' block just
                          after the 'listen', 'root' etc directives.
                          Recommended approach when customizing Nginx's config
                          in most cases, unless you need to set http or
                          fundamental server level options.
                          [default: $COMPOSER_VENDOR_DIR/heroku/heroku-buildpack-php/conf/nginx/default_include.conf.php]
  -c <nginx.conf>         The path to the full configuration file that is
                          included after Heroku's (or your local) Nginx config
                          is loaded. It must contain an 'http { ... }' block
                          with a 'server { ... }' inside that contains 'listen'
                          and 'root' (see option -C above), but no global,
                          directives (globals are read from the system's default
                          Nginx configuration files).
                          [default: $COMPOSER_VENDOR_DIR/heroku/heroku-buildpack-php/conf/nginx/heroku.conf.php]
  -h                      Display this help screen and exit.
  -i <php.ini>            The path to the php.ini file to use.
                          [default: $COMPOSER_VENDOR_DIR/heroku/heroku-buildpack-php/conf/hhvm/php.ini]

Any file name that ends in '.php' will be run through the PHP interpreter first.
You may use this for templating; this is, for instance, necessary for Nginx,
where environment variables cannot be referenced in configuration files.
All file paths must be relative to '$HEROKU_APP_DIR'.

If you would like to use the -C and -c options together, make sure you retain
the appropriate include mechanisms (see default configs for details).
