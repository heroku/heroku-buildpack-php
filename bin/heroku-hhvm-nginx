		${1:-Boots HHVM together with Nginx on Heroku and for local development.}
		
		Usage:
		  heroku-hhvm-nginx [options] [<DOCUMENT_ROOT>]
		
		Options:
		  -C <nginx.inc.conf>     The path to the configuration file to include inside
		                          the Nginx server config (see option -c below). Will
		                          be included inside the 'server { ... }' block just
		                          after the 'listen', 'root' etc directives.
		                          Recommended approach when customizing Nginx's config
		                          in most cases, unless you need to set http or
		                          fundamental server level options.
		                          [default: <BPDIR>/conf/nginx/default_include.conf.php,
		                          or a more version-specific file from a subdirectory]
		  -c <nginx.conf>         The path to the full configuration file that is
		                          included after Heroku's main Nginx config has been
		                          loaded. It must contain an 'http { ... }' block with a
		                          'server { ... }' inside that contains 'listen' and
		                          'root' (see option -C above) directives.
		                          [default: <BPDIR>/conf/nginx/heroku.conf.php,
		                          or a more version-specific file from a subdirectory]
		  -h, --help              Display this help screen and exit.
		  -I <php.extra.ini>      The path to an extra php.ini to use in addition to the
		                          default HHVM php.ini (see option -i below).
		  -i <php.ini>            The path to the php.ini file to use. It is highly
		                          recommended to use the -I option (see above) instead.
		                          [default: <BPDIR>/conf/hhvm/php.ini.php,
		                          or a more version-specific file from a subdirectory]
		  -l <tailme.log>         Path to additional log file to tail to STDERR so its
		                          contents appear in 'heroku logs'. If the file does not
		                          exist, it will be created. Wildcards are allowed, but
		                          must be quoted and must match already existing files.
		                          Note: this option can be repeated multiple times.
		  -p <PORT>               Port to listen on for HTTP traffic. If this argument
		                          is not given, then the port number to use is read from
		                          the \$PORT environment variable, or a random port is
		                          chosen if that variable does not exist.
		  -v, --verbose           Be more verbose during startup.
		
		The <BPDIR> placeholder above represents the base directory of this buildpack:
		$bp_dir
		
		All file paths must be relative to '$HEROKU_APP_DIR'.
		
		Any file name that ends in '.php' will be run through the PHP interpreter first.
		You may use this for templating; this is, for instance, necessary for Nginx,
		where environment variables cannot be referenced in configuration files.
		
		If you would like to use the -C and -c options together, make sure you retain
		the appropriate include mechanisms (see default configs for details).
