		${1:-Boots HHVM together with Apache2 on Heroku and for local development.}
		
		Usage:
		  heroku-hhvm-apache2 [options] [<DOCUMENT_ROOT>]
		
		Options:
		  -C <httpd.inc.conf>     The path to the configuration file to include inside
		                          the Apache2 VHost config (see option -c below). Will
		                          be included inside the '<VirtualHost>' section just
		                          after the '<Directory>' & 'ProxyPassMatch' directives.
		                          Recommended approach when customizing Apache2's config
		                          in most cases, unless you need to set fundamental
		                          server level options.
		                          [default: \$COMPOSER_VENDOR_DIR/heroku/heroku-buildpack-php/conf/apache2/default_include.conf]
		  -c <httpd.conf>         The path to the full VHost configuration file that is
		                          included after Heroku's (or your local) Apache2 config
		                          is loaded. Must contain a 'Listen \${PORT}' directive
		                          and should have a '<VirtualHost>' and likely also a
		                          '<Directory>' section (see option -C above).
		                          [default: \$COMPOSER_VENDOR_DIR/heroku/heroku-buildpack-php/conf/apache2/heroku.conf]
		  -h, --help              Display this help screen and exit.
		  -I <php.extra.ini>      The path to an extra php.ini to use in addition to the
		                          default HHVM php.ini (see option -i below).
		  -i <php.ini>            The path to the php.ini file to use. It is highly
		                          recommended to use the -I option (see above) instead.
		                          [default: \$COMPOSER_VENDOR_DIR/heroku/heroku-buildpack-php/conf/hhvm/php.ini.php]
		  -l <tailme.log>         Path to additional log file to tail to STDERR so its
		                          contents appear in 'heroku logs'. If the file does not
		                          exist, it will be created. Wildcards are allowed, but
		                          must be quoted and must match already existing files.
		                          Note: this option can be repeated multiple times.
		  -p <PORT>               Port to listen on for HTTP traffic. If this argument
		                          is not given, then the port number to use is read from
		                          the \$PORT environment variable, or a random port is
		                          chosen if that variable does not exist.
		  -v, --verbose           Be more verbose during startup.
		
		All file paths must be relative to '$HEROKU_APP_DIR'.
		
		Any file name that ends in '.php' will be run through the PHP interpreter first.
		You may use this for templating although this is less useful than e.g. for Nginx
		where unlike in Apache2, you cannot reference environment variables in config
		files using a '\${VARNAME}' syntax.
		
		If you would like to use the -C and -c options together, make sure you retain
		the appropriate include mechanisms (see default configs for details).

# 2a) remove our FIFO from above
# 2b) kill all the subshells we've spawned - they in turn have their own traps to kill their respective subprocesses, and because we use SIGUSR1, they know it's the parent's cleanup and can handle it differently from an external SIGKILL

# 2) each subshell also has a trap on TERM that
# 2a) kills $! (the last process executed)
# 2b) ... which in turn will hit the EXIT trap and that unblocks the 'wait' in 5) which will cause the parent to clean up when the exit at the end of the script is hit

# 2d) finally, if $BASHPID exists, the subshell kills itself using the right signal for maximum compliance ($$ doesn't work in subshells, and $BASHPID is not available in Bash 3, but unlike with the parent, it's not that critical to have this)
# 3) each subshell has another trap on USR1 which gets sent when the parent is cleaning up; it works like 2a) but doesn't trigger the EXIT trap to avoid multiple cleanup runs by the parent
# 4) execute the command in the background
# 5) 'wait' on the command (wait is interrupted by an incoming TERM to the subshell, whereas running 4) in the foreground would wait for that process to finish before triggering the trap)
# 6) add the PID of the subshell to the array that the EXIT trap further above uses to clean everything up
