		error <<-EOF
			Dependency installation failed!
			
			The 'composer install' process failed with an error. The cause
			may be the download or installation of packages, or a pre- or
			post-install hook (e.g. a 'post-install-cmd' item in 'scripts')
			in your '$COMPOSER'.
			
			Typical error cases are out-of-date or missing parts of code,
			timeouts when making external connections, or memory limits.
			
			Check the above error output closely to determine the cause of
			the problem, ensure the code you're pushing is functioning
			properly, and that all local changes are committed correctly.

			2) run 'composer update' to re-generate the lock file
