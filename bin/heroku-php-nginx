${1:-Boots PHP-FPM together with Nginx on Heroku and for local development.}

Usage:
  heroku-php-nginx [options] [<DOCUMENT_ROOT>]

Options:
  -C <nginx.inc.conf>     The path to the configuration file to include inside
                          the Nginx server config (see option -c below). Will
                          be included inside the 'server { ... }' block just
                          after the 'listen', 'root' etc directives.
                          Recommended approach when customizing Nginx's config
                          in most cases, unless you need to set http or
                          fundamental server level options.
                          [default: \$COMPOSER_VENDOR_DIR/heroku/heroku-buildpack-php/conf/nginx/default_include.conf.php]
  -c <nginx.conf>         The path to the full configuration file that is
                          included after Heroku's (or your local) Nginx config
                          is loaded. It must contain an 'http { ... }' block
                          with a 'server { ... }' inside that contains 'listen'
                          and 'root' (see option -C above), but no global,
                          directives (globals are read from the system's default
                          Nginx configuration files).
                          [default: \$COMPOSER_VENDOR_DIR/heroku/heroku-buildpack-php/conf/nginx/heroku.conf.php]
  -F <php-fpm.inc.conf>   The path to the configuration file to include at the  
                          end of php-fpm.conf (see option -f below), in the
                          '[www]' pool section. Recommended approach when
                          customizing PHP-FPM's configuration in most cases,
                          unless you need to set global options.
  -f <php-fpm.conf>       The path to the full PHP-FPM configuration file.
                          [default: \$COMPOSER_VENDOR_DIR/heroku/heroku-buildpack-php/conf/php/php-fpm.conf]
  -h, --help              Display this help screen and exit.
  -i <php.ini>            The path to the php.ini file to use.
                          [default: \$COMPOSER_VENDOR_DIR/heroku/heroku-buildpack-php/conf/php/php.ini]
  -l <tailme.log>         Path to additional log file to tail to STDERR so its
                          contents appear in 'heroku logs'. If the file does not
                          exist, it will be created. Wildcards are allowed, but
                          must be quoted and must match already existing files.
                          Note: this option can be repeated multiple times.
  -v, --verbose           Be more verbose during startup.

All file paths must be relative to '$HEROKU_APP_DIR'.

Any file name that ends in '.php' will be run through the PHP interpreter first.
You may use this for templating; this is, for instance, necessary for Nginx,
where environment variables cannot be referenced in configuration files.

If you would like to use the -C and -c or -F and -f options together, make sure
you retain the appropriate include mechanisms (see default configs for details).
