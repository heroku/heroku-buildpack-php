		${1:-Boots PHP-FPM together with Apache2 on Heroku and for local development.}
		
		Usage:
		  heroku-php-apache2 [options] [<DOCUMENT_ROOT>]
		
		Options:
		  -C <httpd.inc.conf>     The path to the configuration file to include inside
		                          the Apache2 VHost config (see option -c below). Will
		                          be included inside the '<VirtualHost>' section just
		                          after the '<Directory>' & 'ProxyPassMatch' directives.
		                          Recommended approach when customizing Apache2's config
		                          in most cases, unless you need to set fundamental
		                          server level options.
		                          [default: <BPDIR>/conf/apache2/default_include.conf,
		                          or a more version-specific file from a subdirectory]
		  -c <httpd.conf>         The path to the full VHost configuration file that is
		                          included after Heroku's (or your local) Apache2 config
		                          is loaded. Must contain a 'Listen \${PORT}' directive
		                          and should have a '<VirtualHost>' and likely also a
		                          '<Directory>' section (see option -C above).
		                          [default: <BPDIR>/conf/apache2/heroku.conf,
		                          or a more version-specific file from a subdirectory]
		  -F <php-fpm.inc.conf>   The path to the configuration file to include at the
		                          end of php-fpm.conf (see option -f below), in the
		                          '[www]' pool section. Recommended approach when
		                          customizing PHP-FPM's configuration in most cases,
		                          unless you need to set global options.
		  -f <php-fpm.conf>       The path to the full PHP-FPM configuration file.
		                          [default: <BPDIR>/conf/php/php-fpm.conf,
		                          or a more version-specific file from a subdirectory]
		  -h, --help              Display this help screen and exit.
		  -i <php.ini>            The path to the php.ini file to use.
		                          [default: <BPDIR>/conf/php/php.ini]
		  -l <tailme.log>         Path to additional log file to tail to STDERR so its
		                          contents appear in 'heroku logs'. If the file does not
		                          exist, it will be created. Wildcards are allowed, but
		                          must be quoted and must match already existing files.
		                          Note: this option can be repeated multiple times.
		  -p <PORT>               Port to listen on for HTTP traffic. If this argument
		                          is not given, then the port number to use is read from
		                          the \$PORT environment variable, or a random port is
		                          chosen if that variable does not exist.
		  -v, --verbose           Be more verbose during startup.
		
		The <BPDIR> placeholder above represents the base directory of this buildpack:
		$bp_dir
		
		All file paths must be relative to '$HEROKU_APP_DIR'.
		
		Any file name that ends in '.php' will be run through the PHP interpreter first.
		You may use this for templating although this is less useful than e.g. for Nginx
		where unlike in Apache2, you cannot reference environment variables in config
		files using a '\${VARNAME}' syntax.
		
		If you would like to use the -C and -c or -F and -f options together, make sure
		you retain the appropriate include mechanisms (see default configs for details).

# 2) call cleanup() to
# 2a) kill all the subshells we've spawned, in reverse order - they in turn have their own traps to kill their respective subprocesses
# 2b) send STDERR to /dev/null so we don't see "no such process" errors - after all, one of the subshells may be gone
# 2c) || true so that set -e doesn't cause a mess if the kill returns 1 on "no such process" cases
# 2d) 'wait' on that killed subprocess, sending wait's output to /dev/null - this prevents the logs getting cluttered with "vendor/bin/heroku-...: line 309:    96 Terminated" messages (we can't use 'disown' after launching programs for that purpose because that removes the jobs from the shell's jobs table and then we can no longer 'wait' on the program)

# 3b) ... or if something crashed, or e.g. Heroku's process manager sent SIGTERM to all processes in the group, in which case a graceful shutdown attempt is futile anyway
