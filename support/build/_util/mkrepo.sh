# load and filter all the given manifests in two steps: 1) expand shared PHP extensions; 2) sort
# expand shared PHP extensions by creating a dummy package for every extension (in every PHP package) that is built as shared, so the solver can correctly pick it for installation
# sort so that packages with the same name and version (e.g. ext-memcached 2.2.0) show up with their php requirement in descending order - otherwise a Composer limitation means that a simple "ext-memcached: * + php: ^7.0.0" request would install 7.0.latest and not 7.4.latest, as it finds the 7.0.* requirement extension first and sticks to that instead of 7.4. For packages with identical names and versions (but different e.g. requirements), Composer basically treats them as equal and picks as a winner whatever it finds first. The requirements have to be written like "x.y.*" for this to work of course (we replace "*", "<=" and so forth with "0", as that's fine for the purpose of just sorting - otherwise, a comparison of e.g. "^7.0.0" and "7.0.*" would cause "TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'")
