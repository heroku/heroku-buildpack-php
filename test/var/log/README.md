The `parallel_runtime_rspec.*.log` files in this directory are here on purpose.

They're test runtime logs generated by `parallel_tests`, and they are output at the end of a run.

They should, for each stack, periodically be copied from the test run logs and updated here in the repository, so that balanced grouping of test runs works well for minimal execution time.
